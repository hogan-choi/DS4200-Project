Stress Levels:
  1. Stress Level and Various Factors Relationship:
     This bar chart shows the correlation between the different categories of the dataset with stress levels for females aged 18 - 25 years old.

     Marks:
	- The bars on the graph are used to represent the magnitude and direction of the correlation coefficients for each variable.
     Channels:
	- The x-axis is used to display the strength and direction of the correlation for each feature.
	- The y-axis is used to display the features (CGPA, Diet Quality, and Financial Stress).
     	- The colors are used to differentiate between the different directions of the bar's correlation (blue for positive, red for negative).
  2. Stress Level by Course:
     This is a bar chart that depicts the stress average stress levels for each course in the dataset.
     
     Marks: 
	- The bars on the graph are used to represent the numerical value of the average stress levels per class. 
     Channels:
	- The x-axis is used to display the different classes that are present within the dataset.
	- The y-axis is used to display the magnitude of the stress levels for each class.

Depression Scores: 
  1. Depression Score and CGPA Distribution:
     This chart represents two graphs side-by-side. The histogram depicts the average depression scores across the CGPA range. The bar chart displays the distribution of      
     students per depression score.

     Marks: 
     Bars are used to represent the data values for both graphs (average depression scores for the histogram and the number of students for the bar graph). 
     Channels: 
	- The x-axis is used to encode the CGPA ranges and the depression score levels for the graphs.
	- The y-axis is used to depict the average depression scores for the histogram and the number of students for the bar plot. 
  2. Average Depression Score and Different Factors: 
     This is an interactive bar plot that graphically represents the relationship between students' physical activity levels, their stress levels, and their relationship with    
     depression scores.

     Marks: 
     Bars are used to represent the average depression scores for each relationship. 
     Channels:
	- The x-axis is used display the different bins for CGPAs. 
	- The y-axis is used to portray the magnitude of average depression scores for each CGPA bin.

Anxiety Levels: 
  1. Relationship between Sleep Quality, Physical Activity, and Anxiety Score:
     This is a heatmap that displays the relationship of different categories for sleep quality and physical activity with relation to anxiety score.

     Marks:
	- The cells in the heatmap are used to represent the intersection of sleep quality levels and physical activity levels.
     Channels:
	- The x-axis is used to depict the different categories for the Physical Activity feature.
	- The y-axis is used to depict the different categories for the Sleep Quality feature.
     	- The color gradient for each cell displays the magnitude for the average anxiety score. Darker colors correlate with lower anxiety scores while brighter colors are 
          associated with higher anxiety scores.
	- The text within each cell is used to depict the exact value of the average anxiety score for each feature intersection.

  2. This is an interactive horizontally stacked bar chart, showing the distribution of anxiety scores across different features (social support, relationship status, 
     substance use, counseling services, and extracurricular involvement). Users can use the dropdown menu to select different categories to see various perspectives.

     Marks: 
	- The bars on the graph are used to represent the different features for a selected category.
	- The bar segments represent the proportion of individuals at different anxiety score levels with the given category.
     Channels:
	- The x-axis is used to show the proportion of individuals at each anxiety score.
	- The y-axis is used to distinguish the different features for a selected category.
	- The color is used to encode the different anxiety score levels (0 - 5).
	- The interactivity from the dropdown menu is used so that users can view different visualizations for the various categories of the dataset.

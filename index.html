            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding university students' mental health is crucial for assessing their well-being in emotional, psychological, and social dimensions. In recent years, the mental health of university students has become an increasingly important topic, as more students face stress, anxiety, and depression throughout their academic journey. Identifying the key factors that influence these mental health challenges can provide insights into developing effective support systems and interventions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Several factors contribute to students' stress, anxiety, and depression levels, including academic performance, social support, lifestyle choices (such as sleep quality, diet, and physical activity), and demographic factors. Untreated mental illness can cause severe emotional, behavioral, and physical health problems, including unhappiness and decreased enjoyment of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of this analysis is to identify the most significant contributors to stress, anxiety, and depression among students. By examining the relationships between these mental health issues and various influencing factors, we can better understand the unique pressures students face and provide targeted solutions to improve their well-being.

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Bar Plot: Stress Level by Course</h3>
            <iframe src="./html_plots/stress_course_cgpa_with_slope copy.html" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
            <!-- Description -->
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;">
                This interactive graph shows the relationship between average stress level and course. From this graph, we can find that the students from the Medical course have the highest stress level, which is higher than 3. Then you can choose different courses to see the relationship between CGPA and the specific course.
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;">
                From the Business course graph, we can find that the slope of the regression line is 0.24, which shows that the students in Business courses have higher stress levels when their CGPA is higher. This may mean that the courses are difficult, so it’s stressful to get a good CGPA.
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;">
                From the Computer Science course graph, we can see that the slope of the regression line is -0.19. This means that the students are less stressed when their CGPA is higher. This may show that the students who perform well in courses may think the courses are not very difficult.
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;">
                From the Law course graph, the slope of the regression line is 0.05. This indicates a very slight positive relationship between CGPA and stress level, suggesting that students in Law courses experience relatively stable stress levels regardless of their performance. The low slope suggests other factors, such as external expectations or personal interests, may play a larger role in their stress levels.
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;">
                From the Engineering course graph, the slope of the regression line is 0.02, which is almost flat. This indicates a negligible relationship between CGPA and stress level for Engineering students. The slight positive slope may imply that stress marginally increases as students achieve higher grades, but the effect is minimal.
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;">
                From the Medical course graph, the slope of the regression line is 0.06. This small positive slope suggests that students in Medical courses experience slightly more stress as their CGPA increases. Given the high average stress level for Medical students, this reinforces the notion that Medical studies are demanding, and the pressure to excel academically adds to their overall stress.
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;">
                From the “Others” course category graph, the slope of the regression line is -0.07. This indicates a slight negative relationship between CGPA and stress level, suggesting that students in this category feel less stressed when they perform better academically. This could imply that students in “Other” courses find their studies manageable, or that good performance boosts their confidence and reduces stress.
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;">
                In summary, this interactive graph highlights how stress levels vary across courses and how they correlate with academic performance (CGPA). While courses like Business and Medical show a positive correlation between CGPA and stress, suggesting that achieving higher grades may be more stressful, courses like Computer Science and “Others” show a negative or negligible correlation, indicating less stress for better-performing students. These insights provide valuable information on how different academic environments influence student stress.

                This graph shows the correlation between various factors and stress levels among female individuals aged 18-25. The strongest positive correlation is with CGPA, suggesting that students with higher academic performance may experience slightly higher stress, possibly due to increased expectations or workload. Diet quality and extracurricular involvement also show small positive correlations, indicating that students balancing additional commitments or paying attention to diet might feel a slight increase in stress.
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;">
                Conversely, financial stress has the strongest negative correlation, highlighting that financial stability significantly reduces stress levels. Other factors, such as physical activity, semester credit load, and sleep quality, show weaker negative correlations, suggesting these contribute to slightly lower stress. These insights emphasize the importance of supporting high-performing students, promoting physical activity, addressing financial concerns, and improving sleep quality to enhance student well-being.

                The first bar chart, titled “Overall Average Depression Score by CGPA,” shows the relationship between students' CGPA 
                and average depression scores. The graph suggests that students with around a 3.2 and a 2.40 CGPA show the highest average 
                depression score. The result indicates that students across different academic performance levels experience similar 
                depression levels, implying that factors other than academic success may contribute more to depression scores.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 15px;">
                The second bar chart, "Overall Depression Score Distribution," shows the overall depression score distribution among the 
                student population. Most students have depression scores between 0 and 3, with 3 being the most common depression score 
                among students, which shows students typically have a mild to moderate depression level. Depression scores of 4 and 5 are 
                less frequent, indicating that fewer students report higher depression levels.

                The heatmap visualization illustrates the relationship between sleep quality, physical activity levels, and average anxiety scores. The graph suggests that the lowest anxiety score (2.21) is observed among students with good sleep quality and low physical activity levels. Poor sleep quality is associated with higher anxiety scores, particularly when physical activity is high (2.38). Moderate physical activity with good sleep quality corresponds to a slightly higher anxiety score (2.40), potentially indicating the varying impacts of physical activity intensity and rest balance. Average sleep quality shows slightly higher anxiety scores across all activity levels, particularly for high physical activity (2.34). The graph indicates that poor sleep quality and extreme physical activity may increase anxiety, but balanced habits could reduce it.

                In summary, the interactive pie chart provides a detailed visualization of how various features relate to anxiety levels among students. The graph reveals that moderate anxiety levels (score 3) are the most common across all features. Among these, social support and counseling service usage appear to have a more significant influence on anxiety levels compared to relationship status, substance usage, and extracurricular involvement, suggesting students to focus more on social support and counseling service usage.

                We find that academic performance, particularly CGPA, is a significant contributor to stress, with students in courses like Medical and Business experiencing higher stress levels. The analysis suggests Financial stress, physical activity, and sleep quality are critical factors in reducing stress levels.

                Depression levels are moderately consistent across academic performance levels, suggesting that non-academic factors such as lifestyle choices, financial stability, and social support play a larger role in influencing depression. Most students report mild to moderate depression levels, indicating there is a need for preventative measures and early interventions to reduce depression levels.

                For recommendations, the analysis encourages students and schools to focus on social support and counseling services, as enhanced social support systems and the promotion of counseling services can play a pivotal role in reducing anxiety and improving mental health outcomes for students. It’s better to have a balanced lifestyle for all students because good sleep, moderate physical activity, and healthy dietary habits can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Universities should consider providing financial counseling and assistance programs to reduce financial stress, which is a major contributor to student well-being.
